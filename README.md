## Core Philosophy

This library is designed to be the "mathematical engine" for a larger voting application. It follows a pure, functional approach:

* **Pure:** Contains zero external dependencies.
* **Testable:** Can be fully unit-tested without needing a database or network connection.
* **Reusable:** This logic can be imported by any application without tying it to a specific framework. It just takes in data and returns data.
